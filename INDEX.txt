  h1What is Echo Truth Hubh1
  pBuilt and run by someone who got fed up with biased headlines and wanted a place where evidence consensually prevails. Independent, community-funded, and proudly agenda-free.p

  h1Whyh1
  pWe’re exhausted by redacted reality and coloured news. This is a calm, educational and fun safe haven where skeptics, believers and the otherly informed meet on neutral ground, armed only with sources, their wits and logic.p

  h1How it worksh1
  pA peer-controlled learning platform where the community — not editors or algorithms — decide what holds up.brTired of second-guessing sensational headlines Here, real experts and everyday people pitch in their evidence, and the strongest proof earns recognition and reward.p
