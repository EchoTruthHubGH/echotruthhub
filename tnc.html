<h1>Terms & Conditions – the honest stuff nobody loves reading</h1>

<p><strong>This is not gambling.</strong> Echo Truth Hub is a skill-based learning game. The result is decided only by the quality of evidence you bring — never by luck or chance. That’s why it’s legal without a gambling licence (NL + EU law).</p>

<h2>What you're agreeing to</h2>
<p>By playing, you agree to these terms. 18+ only. One €1 entry per bounty via bunq.me (non-refundable). Add “Entry @yourhandle” in notes. SEPA takes 1-2 business days; game waits for all to land.</p>

<h2>How the game flows (merit first)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>72h window: Pay + reply on X with verifiable sources (#TruthWithTeeth)</li>
  <li>Minimum 10 entries for payout (rolls over if low)</li>
  <li>Community likes decide the top contributor</li>
  <li>Best evidence earns max 35% of pot (min €3; scales with entries)</li>
  <li>Announced on X + paid via Bunq within 24h</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your evidence and our rights</h2>
<p>You own your submissions. We can feature winners publicly (with credit). Sources must be public/verifiable—no paywalls, opinions, or fakes. Disqualified entries = no refund.</p>

<h2>Privacy and data</h2>
<p>We collect only what's needed: X handle, payment ref, submission. No selling/sharing. Stored securely via Bunq/GitHub. See full privacy policy (coming soon) or DM for details.</p>

<h2>Changes and disputes</h2>
<p>We may update terms (notified on X; changes apply after). Disputes: DM first for merit-based resolution. If needed, Dutch law in Amsterdam courts. No class actions.</p>

<h2>The boring legal bits</h2>
<p>Educational/entertainment only—no financial/medical advice. Science evolves; we update myths. No warranties—play at your risk. Indemnity: You cover us for your submissions.</p>
