  <h1>What is Echo Truth Hub?</h1>
  <p>Built and run by someone who got fed up with biased headlines and wanted a place where evidence consensually prevails. Independent, community-funded, and proudly agenda-free.</p>

  <h1>Why?</h1>
  <p>We’re exhausted by redacted reality and coloured news. This is a calm, educational and fun safe haven where skeptics, believers and the otherly informed meet on neutral ground, armed only with sources, their wits and logic.</p>

  <h1>How it works</h1>
  <p>A peer-controlled learning platform where the community — not editors or algorithms — decide what holds up.<br>Tired of second-guessing sensational headlines? Here, real experts and everyday people pitch in their evidence, and the strongest proof earns recognition and reward.</p>
