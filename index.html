  <h1>What is Echo Truth Hub?</h1>
  <p>Built and run by someone who got fed up with biased headlines and wanted a place where evidence consensually prevails. Independent, community-funded, and proudly agenda-free.</p>

  <h1>Why?</h1>
  <p>We’re exhausted by redacted reality and coloured news. This is a calm, educational and fun safe haven where skeptics, believers and the otherly informed meet on neutral ground, armed only with sources, their wits and logic.</p>

  <h1>How it works</h1>
  <p>A peer-controlled learning platform where the community — not editors or algorithms — decide what holds up.<br>
  Tired of second-guessing sensational headlines and doing your own research just to learn the truth? Here, real experts and everyday people pitch in their evidence, and the strongest proof earns recognition and reward.</p>
